# Yoga Pose Detector and Corrector

A computer vision-based system that can detect various yoga poses and provide real-time feedback for pose correction, with a specific focus on the Warrior II pose. The project uses MediaPipe for pose estimation and machine learning for pose classification and correction guidance.

## üéØ Features

- **Pose Detection**: Identifies multiple yoga poses using machine learning
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides instant feedback on pose alignment
- **Pose Correction**: Offers visual guidance for proper pose alignment (currently implemented for Warrior II)
- **Angle Analysis**: Calculates key joint angles for precise pose evaluation
- **Visual Overlay**: Shows ideal pose alignment for comparison
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Implements pose prediction smoothing to reduce jitter

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** - For video processing and visualization
- **MediaPipe** - For pose landmark detection
- **NumPy** - For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - For pose classification
- **Joblib** - For model serialization

## üìä System Architecture
